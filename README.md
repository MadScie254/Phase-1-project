# Movie Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze movie data to provide insights and recommendations for a new movie studio. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from IMDB and includes information on movie budgets, release dates, domestic and worldwide gross sales, and other relevant details.

## Business Understanding
The goal of this project is to help the new movie studio make informed decisions about film production by identifying key factors that contribute to a movie's success. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to provide recommendations on movie selection, production budget allocation, leveraging successful collaborations, and optimizing profitability.

## Data Understanding
The dataset, tn.movie_budgets.csv, contains information on movie budgets, release dates, movie titles, domestic and worldwide gross sales. It provides valuable insights into the movie industry, allowing us to analyze trends, relationships, and patterns related to movie success.

## Data Preparation
In the data preparation step, we cleaned the dataset and performed necessary transformations to make it suitable for analysis. This involved converting relevant columns to the appropriate data types, handling missing values, and removing unnecessary columns. The cleaned dataset was then ready for further analysis.

## Data Analysis
Based on the data analysis, we have generated several findings and recommendations:

### Recommendation 1: Identify Profitable Genres
Analyze the genres of successful movies to identify the most profitable genres for the new movie studio. This can be done by examining the relationship between genre and worldwide gross sales.

### Recommendation 2: Release Month Impact
Consider the impact of release month on movie success. Analyze the distribution of worldwide gross sales across different release months to identify any trends or seasonal patterns.

### Recommendation 3: Optimize Production Budget Allocation
Analyze the relationship between production budget and profitability. Determine the optimal allocation of the production budget to maximize profitability.

### Recommendation 4: Leverage Successful Director-Actor Collaborations
Identify successful director-actor collaborations and leverage them in movie production. Analyze the historical data to identify director-actor pairs that have consistently achieved high gross sales.

## Visualization
The project includes three visualizations to support the findings and recommendations. These visualizations are designed to provide clear insights into the data and aid in decision-making.
